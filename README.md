GhostManSec, or GMS Sploit, is a powerful tool with 8 diverse functions. 

- Firstly, it has the ability to create a Backdoor, allowing users to remotely access a system with ease. Next, GMS Sploit can perform layer7 DDoS attacks, overloading the target server by attacking web applications.

- Additionally, this tool also supports layer4 DDoS attacks, causing network overload and disrupting services on the server. GMS Sploit can also check if the target is vulnerable to SQLi (SQL Injection), a common security loophole in web applications. It can also check for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, another loophole that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a website.
- The tool provides a feature to test the admin login page (Page Login Admin), helping users detect security vulnerabilities in the login system. GMS Sploit also supports checking the ports of a server, helping to determine open and closed ports on the system.

- Lastly, this tool allows for the exploitation of SQLi security vulnerabilities and gathering information from the database. This helps users identify security loopholes and gather important information from the target system.
